# Comic Website Crawler 

## Motivation

When reading comics on a website, I encounter numerous visible and hidden advertisements. 
Additionally, each chapter has few images. To address these inconveniences, I created a small program that crawls content from multiple chapters and displays the output in a single HTML file.
## How to use the program 

### Usage 

```bash
usage: ComicCrawler
 -e,--end <arg>     end chapter number
 -s,--start <arg>   start chapter number
 ```

### Run the program
```bash
    java -jar .\comic-crawler-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
